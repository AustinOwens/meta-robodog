# The poky/meta/classes-recipe/core-image.bbclass implements the mapping of strings in
# the global variable IMAGE_FEATURES to predefined packagegroups. What IMAGE_FEATURES
# allows us to do is to change the content of the core-image-base.bb image without
# editing the file, and we can simply add pre-defined features to the global variable
# IMAGE_FEATURES. This also allows us to create definitions of IMAGE_FEATURES that will
# be applicable to all images that are derived from the core-image.bbclass.
IMAGE_FEATURES += "ssh-server-dropbear package-management"

# Install additional software packages
CORE_IMAGE_EXTRA_INSTALL += "robodog-packagegroup-testapps"
